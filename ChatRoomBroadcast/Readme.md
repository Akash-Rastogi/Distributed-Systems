Download and Install mysql:
https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

Run mysql server and create a database named:    ‘chatroom’

Note: Configuration of mysql inside code is present in    /lib/server.js

Change Username, Password accordingly to run the app.

To run the chat app, go to folder location, then:

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local server
npm run server

# Run the client (multiple times for multiple clients)
npm start

Note: Every ‘npm start’ starts a new client as a new process.

Completed both the parts for extra points. (Saving to db and creating new process for every client).
